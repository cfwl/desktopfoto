# desktopfoto
An application which if minimized will take a screenshot every x seconds and stores it on a predetermined place on your harddrive or so
if window is shown it will stop taking screenshot and allow you  to configurate the x second interval and/or the place
where the pictures are stored. On saving it will minimize itself and take screenshots once more until you end the program

#to do..
Rewrite it to be an application which will reside in the system tray with a configuration form with the option to 
hide the application from taskbar/systemtray. (Find a way to access the configuration form even with the hide option inplace!!!!
